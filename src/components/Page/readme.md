# Interview question 1

- use url 'https://gist.githubusercontent.com/afiedler/3f388de6159f84bbe330e1a8289006a6/raw/59a2f67bbe0e4891bba22241406d7bd93bd8fb6b/parks.json' to get national park information
- make a table from it / including pictures
- add search function
- add sort by name/location function

They didn't extend offer so probably not a great solution? but I have no idea what they wanted to see

 ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
